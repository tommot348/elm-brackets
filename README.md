elm-brackets
============

Elm support for brackets.

Currently support:
- Syntax highlight(may need some work)
- Simple file build with output panel (fetches all dependencies)
- Jump to error on click in build output / lint output
- Quasilint (compiler output is used as lint)(does not fetch dependencies)
- dependency install (via elm-package install)

Roadmap:
- elm-format support
- elm-oracle support
- Package Manager
- Preferences (configurable binary path, "build/format on save" option, etc)

elm binaries have to be in PATH for this to work
